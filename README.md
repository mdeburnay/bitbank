## Bitbank

Had a lot of fun with this one but ran out of steam near the end.

Copied the vast majorty of the work from [this repo](https://github.com/briancodex/nextjs-crypto-api), but added and edited here and there to include pagination and mobile responsiveness.

Things I would like to do in the future:

- The above
- More componentisation of the frontend
- Add a title bar to the coin table in order to correctly reference the table contents (e.g. Price, Market Cap, Logo etc..)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
