## Bitbank

Had a lot of fun with this one but ran out of steam near the end.

Copied the vast majorty of the work from [this repo](https://github.com/briancodex/nextjs-crypto-api), but edited here and there to include pagination and mobile responsiveness.

Things I would like to do in the future:

- More componentisation of the frontend
- Add a title bar to the coin table in order to correctly reference the table contents (e.g. Price, Market Cap, Logo etc..)
- Bringing all crypto coins in and then paginating the array in the frontend would be nice. This will allow me to search through the entire list of coins, rather than just the 50 that are rendered per page.
- Adding unit tests

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
